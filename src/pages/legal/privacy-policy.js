				<h2>II. Services and Wallet Registration</h2>
				<h3>Bitriel: digital wallet Registration and Safety.</h3>
				<p>
					To use Bitriel: digital wallet you must create,import a crypto wallet,
					email, phone number, or social media. The moment you create a wallet
					you will have access to your private key. You are solely responsible
					for keeping your private keys safe and confidential and thus you will
					be held responsible for any activities undertaken on your wallet. A
					crypto wallet is a tool used to enhance the security of your Digital
					Assets and in this sense, you should take all measures to avoid the
					loss of access or control of your Bitriel: digital wallet. Some safety
					recommendations are to create a strong and unique password to your
					wallet, to use the backup option of Bitriel: digital wallet and to
					safely store your mnemonic phrase. You agree to immediately notify us
					of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach
					of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from
					your failure to comply with this paragraph. As you may be aware, you
					must keep your private key and mnemonic phrase secure since they may
					enable whoever has access to it to access your wallet and balances. It
					is important to highlight that Selendra team nor any of Selendra
					systems have the capability to help you with password retrieval since
					we do not have access to wallet password, encrypted private key,
					unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with
					your Bitriel: digital wallet. Thus, you accept and acknowledge that
					any Digital Asset associated with a wallet to which you cannot
					remember the access will become inaccessible.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3>Bitriel: digital wallet Services.</h3>
				<p>
					Bitriel: digital wallet stores your keys for the addresses used by you
					to store your Digital Assets in the respective blockchains and does
					not store the Digital Assets themselves. Thus, all transfers are
					performed not in the Bitriel: digital wallet environment but in the
					blockchains over which we do not have any control. In this sense, we
					cannot and do not ensure that any transaction instructed by you
					through Bitriel: digital wallet will be confirmed and processed by the
					respective blockchain. You accept and acknowledge that Bitriel:
					digital wallet is not responsible for transfer registration in the
					respective blockchains nor for errors or omissions that you make in
					relation to transactions involving your Digital Assets.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3>Transfer of Funds to Bitriel: digital wallet.</h3>
				<p>
					If you decide to use Bitriel: digital wallet, it is needed to transfer
					funds to your Bitriel: digital wallet. This transaction may be subject
					to fees charged by the service provider of your use (external wallet
					or third part exchange). Bitriel: digital wallet has no kind of
					relationship with these third-party service providers, their fees, and
					the security of such tools. Considering that the speed of a transfer
					may vary depending on the blockchain used by you and on the fees, you
					opt to pay on each transfer you order or instruct, it is important to
					highlight that Bitriel: digital wallet cannot guarantee nor regulate
					the speed of transfer of funds from any third-party service provider
					into your Bitriel: digital wallet. Additionally, it is of your own
					responsibility to make sure that you are using an address that matches
					the blockchain of a specific Digital Asset being transferred by you
					into Bitriel: digital wallet since a mistakenly instructed order may
					cause the permanent loss of your Digital Assets. Therefore, you agree,
					acknowledge, and declare that you are solely responsible for the
					management of such funds, their security, and costs of any transfer
					funds into Bitriel: digital wallet.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3>Transfer of Funds from Bitriel: digital wallet.</h3>
				<p>
					Transfer of funds from your Bitriel: digital wallet to any account
					kept in a third-party service provider is possible whenever balance is
					available in your Bitriel: digital wallet. In case the transfer order
					is rejected by an external account, sent to an unavailable account or
					to a mistakenly informed address you agree that you will not hold
					Bitriel: digital wallet liable for such transactions if your funds are
					lost. Fess will be charged on the transfer of funds from Bitriel:
					digital wallet account based on the fees applicable on the chosen
					blockchain or network at the moment of the transaction. Considering
					that the speed of a transfer may vary depending on the blockchain used
					by you on a specific transfer you order or instruct, it is important
					to highlight that Bitriel: digital wallet cannot guarantee nor
					regulate the speed of transfer of funds to a third-party service
					provided from your Bitriel: digital wallet and you understand and
					acknowledge that it may vary depending on general market conditions.
					The fees applicable to these transactions may also vary depending on
					the blockchain chosen by you and general market conditions.
					Additionally, it is of your own responsibility to make sure that you
					are using an address that matches the blockchain of a specific Digital
					Asset being transferred by you to transfer your assets from Bitriel:
					digital wallet to a third-party service provider since a mistakenly
					instructed order may cause the permanent loss of your Digital Assets.
					Bitriel: digital wallet cannot cancel or modify a transaction
					submitted by you since we have no control on the blockchains chosen by
					you to transfer your funds. Also, you must make sure to have funds to
					transfer and to pay for the costs of this transfer (gas) since
					transactions may fail due to insufficient funds or gas. Therefore, you
					agree, acknowledge, and declare that you are solely responsible for
					the management of your funds, their security, and costs of any
					transfer funds from Bitriel: digital wallet.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3>Fees.</h3>
				<p>
					No fees are currently charged for the use of Bitriel: digital wallet

					updated at Bitriel´s discretion at any time being applicable from the
					effective date indicated in our communication. By agreeing to this
